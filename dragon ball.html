<p><h3>It all starts five years after the wedding of Goku, when a strange spaceship lands on our planet carrying a powerful warrior with extraordinary strength. He collides with Junior and defeats him, but his goal is Goku, therefore he heads to the Kame house, where our protagonist is reunited with his friends Krillin, Bulma, Roshi and his son, Son Gohan, born of his marriage to Chi-Chi.
    He resembles his father in all respects, even in the tail (if it weren't for the hair, it would be difficult to distinguish him from Goku small). The super-powered alien who suddenly swoops down on the group is actually the brother of Goku: Radditz, who reveals a big secret. Goku he is an extraterrestrial, a saiyan born on the planet Vegetate. Radditz wants his brother Goku join him, but given his opposition, to convince him, he decides to kidnap Son Gohan.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>To recover his son, Goku, accepts Junior's invitation to ally with him, furious against Radditz and determined to avenge the previous defeat. We then arrive at the moment of the very hard battle, where Radditz shows all his power, in fact Junior loses an arm (but has the power to regenerate, therefore it grows back), Goku knows what the weak point is and therefore squeezes its tail defeating it. But the loyalty of Goku it is certainly not similar to that of his brother, in fact after freeing him, Radditz cowardly strikes Goku, taking him by surprise. At this point Son Gohan enters the scene, who furious, shows all his power by throwing it on Radditz, he is surprised and Goku he takes the opportunity to block him from behind.</h3></p>
<p><h3>At this point Junior launches the very powerful Makankosappo (demonic cannon with a piercing light) and kills the two brothers. Junior tells the dying Radditz the secret of the dragon balls, while the latter warns that in a year two other saiyans will arrive, much stronger than him in order to take the balls. The body of Goku is taken away by the Supremo, while Junior decides to train Gohan.</h3></p>
<p><h3>Goku,in the afterlife, he meets king Kaioha, the king of the world and decides to train and strengthen himself with him, learning new techniques, such as kaioh ken and Genkidama. Meanwhile the warriors of the famous tournament Tenkaichi: Yamco, Tenshinhan, Jiaozi, Krillin and Yajirobe prepare for the arrival of the Saiyans, training with The Supreme.
    After a year, the saiyans arrive, who claim that in reality Junior is an alien, coming from the planet Namek. The clash between all the strongest earthlings and the two saiyans is very violent. These kill Yamco, Jiaozi, Tenshinhan, The Supreme and it would also have been the turn of little Son Gohan if it hadn't been for Junior, who sacrifices his life to save him. Goku he decides to return from the afterlife to defeat the saiyans, sure of his strength which has been enhanced by the training and tricks learned from King Kaioha. He injures the alien Nappa, but has to deal with Vegetate, the other saiyan even stronger than the previous one.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>Being a saiyan, Goku he will have to collide with his own kind. Goku while fighting with Vegetate, uses the kaioh ken (strengthening technique), Vegetate in response, he creates an artificial moon and transforms into an ape, striking hard Goku. Yajirobe, knows about the weak point of the saiyans, mindful of the tales of Goku, therefore, cut the tail a Vegetatewhich returns as before. At that time Goku hits Vegetate with the Genkidama, the very powerful ball of energy, but despite the very violent impact, Vegetate manages to resist. The son of Goku, Gohan looking at the Moon created by Vegetate, he too becomes an ape and invests Vegetate, with its tremendous strength. Vegetate is spared from Goku and his fellow survivors Krillin and Yajirobe.</h3></p>
<p><h3>From the stories of the aliens, it seems that on the planet Namek, there are other dragon balls, the thing does not escape the great researcher Bulma who, in the company of Krillin and little Gohan, decide to go to this planet, without Goku still recovering from the hard fight. Here they discover that the planet has been occupied by super powerful aliens, commanded by the evil Freeza, who is in search of the spheres, in order to express the desire for eternity. Vegetate he rebels against Freeza when he discovers that his planet has been destroyed by the latter, because he feared the power of the Saiyans, so he decides to take possession of the spheres too. He succeeds in his intent by stealing the five spheres found by Freeza, while Krillin has a sphere much larger than the terrestrial ones as a gift from the head of the planet Namek and can obtain three wishes. It's at that view Goku goes crazy, transforms into the legendary Super Saiyan.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>Vegetate and Trunks after exiting the Room of Spirit and Time, head towards Cell and with their super strength, they defeat him, but Cell challenges Vegetate, telling him that if he absorbed c18's powers he would become perfect and he could fight a perfect being. Vegetate he cannot resist the temptation of such an enthralling fight and despite his son Trunks' attempt to dissuade him, he allows Cell to realize his intention.Vegetate he can then fight with this perfect body. Very soon Vegetate he realizes that he has sinned by naivety and given the difficulty encountered in the fight with Cell, he decides to hit him with the Final Flash, a terrible blow. Cell regenerates thanks to the powers absorbed by Junior and thus defeats Vegetate.
    Cell gives a respite. He decides to organize a martial arts tournament where he can fight alone against all the z warriors.</h3></p>
    <p><h3>Then the tournament begins. They will also participate in this Goku and Gohan who came out of the room of Spirit and Time, regenerated. The first to face Cell is a certain Mr Satan who makes everyone believe he is the strongest man on earth, but is quickly defeated. The second challenger is right Goku who with his new power manages to destroy the upper half of Cell, but he has the power to regenerate himself, again thanks to Junior's powers. It's now Gohan's turn. During the fight between Cell and Gohan, c16 intervenes against Cell, who however defeats him by destroying him and creating many small Cells to face the z warriors.

The tournament begins with the junior stage, where only children can participate. Here Trunks beats Goten. In the adult tournament Krillin beats Punter. Junior, on the other hand, will have to deal with none other than Kaioh-shin, the god of kings Kaioh who came from the afterlife and in fact loses.
